Titanic Dataset Analysis
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. It visualizes key insights related to survival rates, demographic characteristics, and relationships between various features using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Features
Visualizations
Bar Chart: Survival Rate by Class (Pclass)

Insights: Higher classes had better survival rates.
Bar Chart: Survival Rate by Gender

Insights: Females had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.
Scatter Plot: Fare vs. Age by Survival

Insights: Younger passengers and those paying higher fares were more likely to survive.
Countplot: Passengers by Embarkation Port

Insights: Most passengers embarked from Southampton, with survival rates varying by port.
Violin Plot: Survival Distribution by Age

Insights: Children had a better survival rate compared to adults.
Pie Chart: Proportion of Survivors vs. Non-Survivors

Insights: Two-thirds of passengers did not survive.
Histogram: Age Distribution

Insights: Most passengers were aged 20–40 years.
Box Plot: Fare Distribution by Class

Insights: First-class passengers paid significantly higher fares.
Line Plot: Survival Rate by Family Size

Insights: Smaller family sizes (1–3 members) had higher survival rates.
Scatter Plot: Age vs. Fare by Survival

Insights: Younger passengers with higher fares were likelier to survive.
Heatmap: Correlation Between Numerical Features

Insights: Fare is positively correlated with survival, while Pclass is negatively correlated.
